2c97cb8e-e75f-4ae4-bd31-abb484a57295,"MDsave provides a single online location for consumers to research, compare, and purchase medical services with total cost transparency.MDsave has announced the addition of laboratory/pathology services to its medical service listings.  With the proliferation of high deductible health plans, the push for price transparency is a hot topic.MDsave, a Brentwood, TN based healthcare startup, is aiming to be an “Expedia of health care”.  MDsave is the first e-commerce company to offer a single online resource for consumers to research, compare, and purchase healthcare services at significant discounts.  Launched June 2012, MDsave is already in 3 large metro markets and likely to expand to another 4 this year.MDsave is in partnership with SSM Healthcare Oklahoma, parent organization to St Anthony Hospital. The partnership encompasses more than 225 healthcare providers across 20 locations and over 200 procedures and services that include MRIs, flue shots, CT scans, and specialty visits.With the current challenges in the healthcare marketplace, this couldn’t come at a better time for St. Anthony’s patients and the Oklahoma City community. Because an individual can purchase medical procedures and services directly from physicians, MDSave eliminates the complexity that many are currently experiencing with health insurance exchanges. Also, with thousands of Americans temporarily finding themselves with canceled health plans, MDSave helps these individuals to immediately save on their current pressing and preventive healthcare needs. Over the long term, as government leaders work through these challenges and more Americans sign up for high-deductible plans, the need for reducing out-of-pocket costs will only increase.MDsave is also in partnership with Weatherford Regional Medical Center outside of Fort Worth, whose parent company is Community Health Systems, one of the nation’s leading hospital systems.  Weatherford currently offers imaging services and has just added all of its lab/pathology services as well.  Outpatient surgeries and physician office visits will be added to the listing soon.MDsave’s unique bundling technology makes medical procedures transparent, shoppable, and instantly transactable. Through MDsave’s patented collection software, patients pay one upfront price for prospective or retrospective care, and payment is automatically distributed to all bundle participants within 4 days.For example, an MRI would typically cost a patient without insurance $2,074.77, while a patient with a high deductible plan would pay $1,231.96. By researching and booking through MDSave, that same patient could get an MRI at Weatherford Regional Medical Center for $425, resulting in a more than 65 percent savings. A patient who needs an X-ray would typically pay $181.26 without insurance and $107.66 with a high deductible plan. Through MDSave, he or she could pay $82 at Weatherford, resulting in a more than 23 percent savings. The typical CT scan would cost an uninsured patient $1,374.53 and a high-deductible patient $816.41. An MDSave user could book and get the scan for $350 at Weatherford, at more than 57 percent savings.MDsave announced its latest partnership in the Nashville market in April.   In an effort to bring more consumers greater access to colonoscopies, AMSURG Corp. and MDSave are launching a pilot program to introduce bundled pricing for the procedure to two Nashville-area surgery centers. Associated Endoscopy in Hermitage and St. Thomas Medical Group Endoscopy Center in Nashville will offer a fixed cost for the procedure to a high deductible, self-pay, and under-insured patients at a lower rate than those individuals would typically pay. Those who are insured under the Affordable Care Act’s healthcare exchange marketplace will also be eligible for the program. Consumers can access these savings through the MDsave website, www.MDSave.com.Experts recommend colonoscopies for everyone aged 50 and above, and the pilot program will create an option for patients who might otherwise be deterred by the idea that a colonoscopy is financially out of reach. Bundled pricing means that qualified patients will pay a single, set price for all costs associated with the procedure. Without bundled pricing, these patients would receive multiple bills for charges like facility fees and anesthesia fees, which can be confusing and lead to unexpected costs for the patient. This marks only the second time that colonoscopies have been offered with completely bundled pricing – the first being the MDsave partnership with DDSI, a gastroenterology center in Oklahoma City.
Going one step further, this program includes any and all diagnostic procedures that take place during the colonoscopy, such as biopsies, in the bundled price. These procedures are not always covered by insurance when a screening colonoscopy is ordered. The average cost of a colonoscopy in Nashville is $5,175 for uninsured patients and $3,583 for those with a high deductible. With the MDSave partnership, Associated Endoscopy and the St. Thomas Medical Group Endoscopy Center are able to reduce those fees to $1,795 for patients who qualify, representing a significant saving to consumers.Read More"

3ad73f33-fe9c-487d-85b3-d70d00ac6138,"Net AI had developed a cloud-native platform that uses AI to provide real time analytics, which can drive the optimization of virtualized mobile networks. The volume of mobile data traffic is exploding and 5G will have to fulfill a growing variety of performance requirements, ranging from extreme mobile broadband to low-latency automotive IoT. Toaccommodate such demands, enhanced flexibility in managing the infrastructure is needed. Network slicing allows operators to customize resources on a per-service basis, by virtually partitioning the physical infrastructure, thereby enabling new lucrative revenue streams. However, without deep intelligence into the traffic flowing over slices, and where it originates, it is impossible to effectively and efficiently monetize them. To address this need, our Microscope software uses AI to perform mobile traffic decomposition. Microscope identifies and quantifies the nature and source of individual streams (e.g. Netflix, Google cloud services, Facebook, etc; down to individual base station) from aggregate streams. This allows data to be collected in the cloud rather than from expensive location-based probes, and also works with encrypted data sources which are impossible to analyze with traditional approaches such as using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). Our technology tackles the challenges of decomposition through deep learning, due to its effectiveness in operating on large-scale mobile traffic in real-time, as demonstrated by our own research. Microscope is fast, cheap, encryption agnostic, scalable, and compatible with current NFV and open RAN initiativesRead More"

1747c829-a8cc-423c-82a4-862e1df25b3c,"Plants need constant attention, which is why growers inspect their crops to ensure predictable, well-timed harvests as well as protect them from pests and disease. The main inspection methods now available to growers, whether for row crops like wheat, corn or rice, or specialty crops, such as grapes, apples and flowers, are drones and human visualinspection. Yet, both have important limitations. Drones cannot see below the canopy, which is problematic for specialty crops, where the fruits, leaves, shoots, etc. must be observed directly. Human inspection,on the other hand, is not scalable, subjective and often unreliable. Bloomfield cost-effectively overcomes the limitations of both methods and provides direct line-of-site pixel-level inspection using RGB imaging and AI to automatically assess the health and performance of each and every plant in a grow, regardless of plant type, location or number. The result is more predictable and higher yields.Specialty crop growers across North and South America as well as theEU use Bloomfield’s Flash (licensed from and developed by Carnegie Mellon University) cameras which are easily mounted on any type of vehicle available to that grower to inspect any type of crop as often and as much as they need. The result is early and precise yield prediction, well-timed harvests and early detection of and protection from infestation and disease. In a sense, every single plant is monitored from seed through harvest, creating an unprecedented level of transparency in the life of every grower’s plants.Read More"

43f59da1-2466-430b-92e3-22b9d394df60,"There are phrases of how we integrate our core technologies:
LUCA - Blockchain
Features of LUCA Architecture
1. Separating token transactions and computing by connecting the public chain and the private chain;
2. More added values by allowing miners to maintain ledger and realize project computing.As ETH is a sophisticated blockchain supportedby numerous miners, we choose ETH smart contract as transaction medium for AIgatha token.
It can also avoid transaction congestion due to shortage of miners at the early phase of AIgatha.Pangu - Distributed computing system
In this phase, we will implement DC system on the blockchain. Features of Pangu Architecture:
1. The cost of the computing power engaged in the jobs depends the amount of payment. Every task released in the Primordial Soup will be involved with more than two miners.
2. More than 2 miners will be assigned to one task so as to increase the return rate; their results will be verified with each other in order to ensure the accuracy of the results simply.
3. Blockchain make the status of these tasks become open and transparent. Information includes the miners responsible for computing, the computing duration and so on. By doing so, some existing problems in the DC products such as black-box operation will be addressed.
4. Task assignment mechanism is designed to make cloud computing safer by eliminating the possibility that miners cannot assemble the whole picture of one job in spite that they are computing many tasks in one job.
5. Mist computing will reduce the dependence in the cloud computing.
6. Whitelist mechanism only allows users with ID verfication to use the system so as to aviod malicious use.
7. Simple and intuitive-to-use interface and DC API allow users to quickly master the system to solve all kinds of problems.This phase is named Pangu when we will build DC system based on LUCA.IChing - AI services platform
At this phase, we will develop different types of AI services platform based on blockchain.Features of AI Services Platform:
1. Common/Easy File Format: Users only need to save the data file as CSV. file which can be read by the AI services platform for forecasting services.
2. Intuitive-designed Graphic Operation Interface: Programming beginners can easily use AIgatha AI services platform, skipping complicated developing process and background preparation.
3. Multiple AI Agorithms: AIgatha AI servcies platfrom can operate popular AI agorithms and will conclude with the ultimate result based on the statistics of prediction results and the development of AIgatha's technologies.
4. Forecasting Models: users can download the forecasting model built by AIgatha's AI services platform in case that it can be used for the similar topic in the future.
5. Quality Data and Powerful Analysis: data mining and machine learning will help users to develop the best applications and produce the product by searching for the answers as soon as possible.
6. Privacy and Safety: Since AIgatha's AI services platform will work out the forecasting based on statistics, users are not required to provide any name or description of eigenvalues in the dataset. The Chronos Fortress provides edge cache service that means highly privacy, consistency and extenability.
7. Selection of Important Eigenvalues: AIgatha's AI services platform will select eigenvalues for users to know which eigenvalues in the dataset are the key to the prediction, making sure users get the answers together with reasons behind.
8. Detailed and Complete Forecasting Analysis Report: Users are available to purchase the whole forecasting analysis report of the datasets that includes information processed by AI technologies such as relevant background values.Xirang - Complete Blockchain System

Jaya Rao is our current CEO, and Dilip Goswami is president and CTO, and both of them are Molekule co-founders.As a child, Molekule co-founder Dilip Goswami had severe asthma and allergies. His father, Molekuleco-founder Dr. Yogi Goswami, was frustrated by the lack of options for addressing poor indoor air quality. After more than 25 years of research and development, Dr. Goswami and his team decided to bring this groundbreaking technology to consumers for the first time. Both Goswami and Rao are Stanford engineers on a mission to provide better indoor air to everyone who needs it.Our breakthrough methods are fundamentally different from traditional filtration. Rather than trap particles in a filter, Molekule’s patented PECO technology destroys pollutants at the molecular level. Rigorous testing at a multitude of independent, third-party laboratories has carefully tracked and measured the destruction of particles by PECO technology. This is on top of the research Dr. Yogi Goswami did between 2006 and 2015 before helping found Molekule, when he published over 23 reports on this work.While many feel comfortable in their homes, the reality is that indoor air is often stagnant and full of particles. The World Health Organization has noted that 9 out of ten people throughout the world are breathing polluted air — indoors and out. Here at Molekule, we are on a mission to change the current realities for homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, the hospitality industry, and more. After more than 25 years of research and development work, Molekule has made even larger strides in PECO technology and air purification. In 2019, we launched Air Mini to provide a smaller standalone unit at a lower price point for rooms of less than 250 square feet. From dander particles to pollen, there are all kinds of tiny molecules that float in the air and get trapped in homes.In September 2020, we announced our new Air Pro purifier, which has increased airflow, six speed settings, and a particle sensor. The Molekule team’s work to increase airflow reflects how committed we are to addressing pain points stemming from some Molekule review notes and consumer feedback. Our growth as a company has always been focused on addressing the gap in solutions for air quality. Our team is committed to continual improvement in our pursuit of cleaner air, and our technology reflects that. Air Pro has the same sleek and futuristic design as previous Air models. Molekule continues to push forward with new advances for better air purifying solutions with groundbreaking nanotechnology.Our cutting-edge technology has been praised for its ability to destroy viruses and mold. In laboratory tests, Molekule’s PECO technology destroyed over 99.947 percent of a proxy virus (MS2 bacteriophage) in one hour and destroyed over 99.999 percent in 24 hours. Testing has shown that Air reduces a single injection of particulate matter 0.3 to 1.0 micron in size by 85 percent in 22 minutes. The particles destroyed by Air can affect people’s health, especially those with asthma, allergies, and congestion. Molekule units are designed to be quiet and efficient in destroying pollutants, allergens, viruses, and other harmful particles.On the commercial side, Molekule created Air Pro RX in response to a clear need in medical settings. This larger Molekule unit has FDA-granted 510(k) Class II Medical Device Clearance and is intended for healthcare facilities, like clinics and hospitals. Air Pro RX utilizes the same PECO technology as the smaller Air units to destroy bacteria and viruses floating in the air. This is a common need for many healthcare providers that are looking for solutions to help increase safety for patients, employees, and visitors – especially in concentrated waiting rooms, heavy-traffic lobbies, ICUs, isolation units, and emergency departments. Our units do not produce ozone or disturb airflow, and each is rated to cover critical environments of up to 600 square feet.In addition to the Air Pro RX, the FDA has also granted Molekule’s Air Mini and Air Mini+ Class II medical device clearance for the destruction of viruses and bacteria. Developed for smaller spaces in healthcare environments and for medical use in the home, Air Mini and Air Mini+ were demonstrated to have greater than 5-log, or 99.999% reduction of RNA virus MS2, in just two hours.Our team remains committed to building technology-based solutions for a brighter, cleaner and clearer world.Read More"

The promise of autonomous vehicles depends on high-performance, all-weather, low-cost and scalable perception technology, andOculii is bringing it to the world. Oculii's AI software amplifies the resolution of any radar platform, enabling high performance perception for the next generation of autonomous systems. Traditional phased array radars have been used for decades and follow a strict size for performance tradeoff - the larger the sensor aperture, the higher the angular resolution. Oculii’s Virtual Aperture Imaging radar technology fundamentally breaks this tradeoff - enabling its sensors to trade increased compute/processing for angular resolution enhancement with the same physical aperture. Leveraging this technique enables Oculii sensors to extract unprecedented accuracy, range, and 4D positioning information from commodity off the shelf low-cost radar elements, bringing high resolution radar imaging to the next frontier. Oculii is backed by some of the top investors and corporations from Silicon Valley, and is working with the leaders in Self Driving Vehicles, Robotics, and Drones - helping them deliver on an autonomous future with an advanced, robust, affordable perception platform.Read More"

It brings together three products: a comprehensive accounts payable automation system, a leading-edge corporate card program, and fully automated employee expense reimbursements. Simply put, it handles every dollar of non-payroll spend thatleaves a company, from initial request for spend, to booking to the general ledger.Spend management is a different approach and a new way of thinking about how companies spend money. It shifts the relationship between employees and the budget by building accountability into fast-paced workflows and supporting ownership of spending, which are especially vital functions for a distributed workforce.Companies customize approval workflows to ensure the appropriate routing of requests while building an audit trail of compliance for every purchase. Approvals occur in Slack, email, or the Airbase mobile app so that approvers can quickly review and approve or ask questions without having to leave their working communication environment. Accounting automation tools for scheduling, accruing, amortizations, and categorizing transactions save time and eliminate errors. A full selection of payment types, including virtual cards, physical cards, checks, ACH, and vendor credits, all from one control center, make AP teams efficient and even open opportunities to optimize returns by selecting payment types that generate cash back whenever possible. When every dollar of non-payroll spend is handled on one platform, actual spending against the budget can be viewed any day of the week by all stakeholders.Airbase improves operations across the whole company. Employees are empowered to safely and easily get the resources they need to be productive. Managers have oversight and control of their budgets. Finance teams are more efficient with accounting automation. Leadership has access to real-time data for better decision-making. All benefit from Airbase’s well-designed and intuitive user interface that is easy to onboard and simple to use.Finance teams in small and mid-market companies are underserved by existing process automation tools for accounts payable and expense management.

Airbase’s single platform solution can replace many of the software tools that are widely used, including spreadsheets, Expensify, Bill.com, Brex, and AMEX. This replacement streamlines processes, eliminates cross-platform reconciliation needs, and even reveals wasted spend. The Airbase platform consolidates three functional areas without asking users to compromise on the quality or functionality expected from a best-of-breed solution. This allows companies to enjoy the benefits of having everything available in one place and standardized to the same workflows without missing the value of legacy point solutions.Current practices can stymie growth, degrade decision-making, and relegate finance staff to low-value manual work.

We’ve made it our mission to bring certainty to enterprise software investmentsThe enterprise software market is booming, with global spend over $1tn and digital transformation projects starting every day. Yet, despite the unprecedentedpossibilities, businesses throughout the world are not making the most of software’s potential because they don’t have the alignment or measurement they need.Alignment is often assumed. Organizations are quick to deploy SaaS, but while business software can be rolled out rapidly, business change isn’t plug and play. People, processes and objectives need to be integral, not ignored.On top of this, measurement is often missing. If tracked at all, the success of software is often judged on usage, but real value comes from outcomes, not inputs. After all, just because an application is used, it doesn’t mean it’s useful.To realize and keep up with the potential presented by SaaS, we believe businesses need sustainable surety on the outcomes of their software investments, and this can only come from adoption excellence.At AppLearn, we have made it our mission to create this standard and bring certainty to the success of enterprise software.With our AppLearn Adopt platform, unrivalled analytics and an approach that prioritizes people, partnerships and outcomes, we remove the doubt from digital adoption and help organizations to continually make the most of their software.Read More"

Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the Web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.  Without the need forprogrammers.Founded in spring 2011 by a team of seasoned technology and media entrepreneurs with experience in digital marketing, iOS development, consumer media, and business strategy.  Punch is based in New York City.Punch delivers content, known as “mini Apps,” through three components.An App Content Management System (ACMS), accessible through any web browser, provides the authoring environment where tablet native experiences are assembled. These are crafted by first selecting from a range of technical modules, and then uploading into these modules the assets, such as text, images, video, and the instructions, such as animation parameters, that make the content dynamic and interactive. The end result is a series of items that, taken together, become your App. The content management system is accessible through any web browser connected to the Internet.Upon completion of each individual item, the content manager sends the instructions that constitute that item to the Punch server. The server exists on the Internet and stores all the items (assets plus instructions on how they interrelate). Think of each item as a “mini App.”On individual tablets, users download the client App. The client App is a vessel that communicates with the Punch server and receives the assets and instructions for assembling the individual mini Apps that ultimately constitute the end-user experience. Mini Apps can be updated in real time, and the client Apps then download the updated content. This allows for a highly dynamic and responsive publishing environment. Each client App Appears in the App Store under the publisher’s brand. No two client Apps look the same.Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.Read More"

f2aa937e-b0e7-487c-9316-08b44a8381b7,"In B2B, the biggest challenge marketers face is connecting their activities with revenue. There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost. Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? Thebigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential... but also the pain!To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook attribution), giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality. We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources: a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions.We couldn’t find one. So we decided to build one ourselves.Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies who have the ambition to be truly data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars.We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis. Dreamdata integrates with just about any commercial tool and traffic source, so your teams won’t be forced to use certain vendors or suites. You’re free to use best-in-class tools!What if you were asked to double next year's ad spend? What if a pandemic strikes and you’re suddenly forced to cut your marketing activities by 50%? What would you do? Do you actually trust your data enough to present a sound way forward?In situations like these, there’s nothing more dangerous than bad data. What might look like a good plan you want to act on can actually be a bad decision in disguise. Is your B2B’s data prepared and ready to go? By taking care of all the data-crunching, Dreamdata allows demand generation and commercial ops professionals to focus on which B2B go-to-market (GTM) efforts are actually paying off and enables them to repeat the success and stop wasting money. Our out-of-the-box platform helps you to answer vital B2B marketing questions like which campaigns and channels to stop or scale, what’s the return on ad spend, and how long it takes to acquire new customers.If you’re all about granularity it’s even possible to do attribution to (and between!) every pipeline stage as well. Applying attribution to pipeline stages allows Dreamdata customers to optimize every step of their customer journeys. With the Dreamdata insights, B2B marketing and sales align like never before. B2Bs need to realize that revenue creation is most effective when it’s done as a team effort. Every touch of every deal is disclosed. No more guesswork. No more opinions. With this unrivaled transparency, it’s not unusual to see campaign effectiveness and marketing ROI improve by more than 50%.Read More"

The company allows newsrooms to curate, collaborate, search, annotate, verify, and process around social content, as well as publish and tell stories with social content.When the unexpected occurs, everysecond count - millions of dollars are often lost in just the first few minutes after an emergency. Having accurate and relevant data on the location and impact of an emergency event as it unfolds is of paramount importance to those in corporate security, public safety, and emergency response. However, obtaining this information using traditional news media and data analysts is expensive, slow, and prone to error. SAM Inc. has developed a novel tool which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the location of emergency events based on social media chatter. Their proprietary algorithm scans millions of social media posts to detect events such as fire, flooding, tornado, or terrorist attacks, at their earliest stages based on unstructured social media chatter. Following the detection of an event, we use AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to verify the source and triangulate location. This information is then provided to decision-makers so they can take appropriate action quickly and monitor the situation as it unfolds in time and space, minimizing the impact on business operations and risk to personnel. When the unexpected happens, every second counts and SAM provides minutes. SAM was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Edmonton, AB, Canada.Read More"
